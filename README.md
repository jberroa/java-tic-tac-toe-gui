Create a class TicTacToe that will enable you to write a program to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The class contains a private 3-by-3 two-dimensional array.
Use an enumeration to represent the value in each cell of the array.
The enumeration's constants should be named X, O and EMPTY (for a position that does not contain an X or an O).
The constructor should initialize the board elements to EMPTY.
Allow for two human players.
Wherever the first player moves, place an X in the specified square, and place an O wherever the second player moves.
Each move must be to an empty square.
After each move, determine whether the game has been won and whether it's a draw.
If you feel ambitious, modify your program so that the computer makes the moves for one of the players.
